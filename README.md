# Investigating the TMDb Movies Dataset

## Project Overview  
This project was an assignment for the 1st semester **Level 3 Data Science & AI** course in the **Digital Egypt Cubs Initiative (DECI)** by the **Ministry of Communication and Telecommunications**. In this assignment, I analyzed the TMDb Movies dataset, explored its characteristics, and extracted insights using Python.

## Dataset Information  
The dataset used is **TMDb Movie Data**, which has been cleaned from the original [TMDb 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) available on Kaggle. It contains information about movies such as titles, budgets, revenues, genres, release dates, and user ratings.

## Tools and Libraries  
- **Python**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib**  

## Project Goals  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset  
- Identify trends and relationships between different movie attributes  
- Visualize key findings using graphs and charts  

## Files in This Repository  
- **`Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb`** – The Jupyter Notebook with the analysis  
- **`tmdb-movies.csv`** – The dataset used in the project  
- **`Investigate_a_Dataset.html`** – An exported version of the analysis for easy viewing  

## Results  
Through this analysis, I uncovered insights related to movie trends, financial performance, and audience ratings.  

## Acknowledgments  
This project was completed as part of the **DECI Data Science & AI** course, and the dataset was sourced from **Kaggle's TMDb 5000 Movie Dataset**.
